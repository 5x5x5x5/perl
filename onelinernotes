perl -p -e
i.backup   # makes the change - print change to copy and rename copy to original # additional flag needed to keep original

tee

diff

rename command

powerful commands - use in noexec mode until it works as intended

$()  parameter passing

for x in $(perl -p -e 's/seq'  *clipped*);do echo $x;done

for loops are good for doing broad searches
